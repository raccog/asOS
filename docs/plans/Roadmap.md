## kernel

The first step I want to take in building the kernel is a command line with a few features:
* input text
* output text
* output register/memory

The step after this will likely be implementing basic processes, but that could change.

### major

- [ ] setup stack
- [ ] kernel main in C
- [ ] setup interrupt handlers
- [ ] paging
- [ ] command line
- [ ] keyboard input
- [ ] output register command
- [ ] output memory command
- [ ] system dump over uart
- [ ] abstract terminal interface
- [ ] implement serial output
